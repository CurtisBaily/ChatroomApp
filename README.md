# Chatroom App

A chatroom application build using Node.js and Socket.io.

###Installation
This application requires an installation of MongoDB Server installation. It can be either installed locally on the machine which will run the Chatroom App and server the localhost loopback or externally in which case the 'index.js' file will need to be updated with the address of the MongoDb Server.

1. Download by cloning using `git clone https://github.com/CurtisBaily/ChatroomApp.git` or as a zip file.

2. Use `npm install` within the project folder to install the package dependencies.

###Running
1. Within the project folder from the command line use `node index.js`.

2. Open a web browser which can run JavaScript (developed on Chrome) and go to `http://localhost:8000`. The default port number is 8000.
